    <p>Google is one of the most influential and powerful technology companies in the world, known primarily for its search engine, which revolutionized the way people access information. Founded in 1998 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the company started
        as a research project at Stanford University and quickly grew into a global powerhouse. The Google search engine introduced a groundbreaking algorithm called PageRank, which ranked web pages based on relevance rather than just keywords, making
        search results more accurate and useful. Over the years, Google expanded beyond search, developing a vast ecosystem of products and services. Gmail, launched in 2004, became one of the most widely used email services, while Google Maps changed
        the way people navigate the world by providing detailed maps, satellite imagery, and real-time traffic updates. The company's mobile operating system, Android, dominates the global smartphone market, powering billions of devices. Google also entered
        the hardware industry with products like the Pixel smartphones, Nest smart home devices, and the Google Home smart speaker. In 2015, Google reorganized under the umbrella of Alphabet Inc., allowing it to expand into ambitious fields like artificial
        intelligence, quantum computing, and self-driving cars through its subsidiary, Waymo. The company has faced scrutiny over issues like data privacy, antitrust concerns, and its influence on digital advertising, but it continues to lead innovations
        in cloud computing, AI research, and internet services. Today, Google remains a dominant force in the tech industry, shaping the digital world and the way people interact with technology on a daily basis</p>
